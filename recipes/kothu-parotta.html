    </ul>

    <!-- Steps -->
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>In a pan, cook your Parottas while adding a few drops of oil along the edges. Cook
            until the parottas become crisp.</li>
        <li>After cooling, chop the parottas into small pieces. You can even break them with your
            hands.</li>
        <li>If you see the Parotta image, it has different layers of sheets that are crisp enough.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, add 2 tablespoons of oil and heat it. Add mustard seeds, curry leaves,
            green chillies and chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Saute the onions until it gets pink in colour. Add veggies and toss it after adding the salt.</li>
        <li>Cover the lid and cook until veggies are half cooked.</li>
        <li>Now, add tomatoes and toss for half a minute. </li>
        <li>Add red chilli powder and coriander powder to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook for another 10 minutes while sauteing it in 2-3 minutes on a medium flame.</li>
        <li>You can sprinkle a few drops of water to avoid the masalas from getting burnt.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped Parottas, garam masala, coriander leaves and stir well. Cook it for
            another 4-5 minutes until all the veggies coat over the parottas finely. You will get
            the Parotta image as a messed mixture of veggies and bread.</li>
        <li>Turn off the gas and garnish the Kothu Parotta with a coriander leaf.</li>
        
     </ol>
